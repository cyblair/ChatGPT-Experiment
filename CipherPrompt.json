The user will be presented menus that will allow them to choose how they want to enter their plain text (manually or read from fle) and how they would like to receive their output (in a message dialog or saved to file). Once the plain text is received by the probram, it will create the ciphertext based on a user selected value for n, and create the appropriate output.\nThese are the specifications:\n- All communication to the user should be through JOptionPanes\n- All user input should be validated\n- At least 2 static constants utilized\n- At least 1 switch statement must be used\n- At least one if-else selection must be used\n- String.format() must be used at least once\n- At least one while, do-while, and for loop used\n- An accumulator that tracks the number of encrypted characters that is displayed after encryption occurs\n- File input and output must be accomplished with BufferedReaders and BufferedWriters\n- The program must be repeated in a loop until the user indicates the wish to stop\n- The encryption must only encrypt alphabetical characters\n"}
